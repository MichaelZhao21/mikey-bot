# Mikey Bot :DDD

This is my personal Discord bot. It's currently a work in progress, but there are many things that I want it to do :333

## Things it *can* do right now

- Nothing!

## Setup and Execution

Go to the [Discord Developer Portal](https://discord.com/developers) and create a project with a bot. You will need to add this bot to your server and copy the bot token.

Create a file in the root directory called `.env` with the following content:

```js
TOKEN="[The Discord bot token]"
PREFIX="[The prefix for the bot to use (eg. ~)]"
```

Simply run `yarn install` to install it!

To run the bot, type `yarn start`, and it should just work :))
